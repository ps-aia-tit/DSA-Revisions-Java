 eight patterns discussed:

---

🧠 1. Sliding Window

• Use case: Problems involving contiguous sequences (subarrays, substrings).

• Key idea: Maintain a window of elements and slide it across the input to optimize time complexity.

• Examples: Maximum sum subarray of size k, longest substring without repeating characters.


---

🔁 2. Two Pointers

• Use case: Sorted arrays, linked lists, or problems involving pair comparisons.

• Key idea: Use two pointers moving at different speeds or directions to find relationships.

• Examples: Merge two sorted arrays, remove duplicates, reverse a string in-place.


---

🔄 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Cycle Detection)

• Use case: Detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.

• Key idea: One pointer moves faster than the other; if they meet, a cycle exists.

• Examples: Linked list cycle detection, finding cycle length or entry point.


---

📚 4. Merge Intervals

• Use case: Interval scheduling, overlapping ranges.

• Key idea: Sort intervals and merge overlapping ones.

• Examples: Insert interval, merge overlapping meetings, employee free time.


---

📈 5. Binary Search

• Use case: Sorted arrays or search space problems.

• Key idea: Divide and conquer by halving the search space.

• Examples: Search in rotated array, peak element, kth smallest number.


---

🌲 6. Depth-First Search (DFS)

• Use case: Tree traversal, graph exploration, backtracking.

• Key idea: Explore as deep as possible before backtracking.

• Examples: Permutations, combinations, path sum in trees.


---

🌊 7. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

• Use case: Shortest path, level-order traversal.

• Key idea: Explore neighbors level by level using a queue.

• Examples: Minimum depth of binary tree, shortest path in grid.


---

🧩 8. Dynamic Programming (DP)

• Use case: Optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.

• Key idea: Break problems into subproblems and store results to avoid recomputation.

• Examples: Fibonacci, knapsack, edit distance, longest common subsequence.
