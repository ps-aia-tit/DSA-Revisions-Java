ðŸ§® Basic Sorting Algorithms (Time Complexity: O(nÂ²))

â€¢ Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Simple but inefficient for large datasets WsCube Tech.
â€¢ Selection Sort: Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning, repeating for each position GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position 

âš¡ Efficient Comparison-Based Sorting (Time Complexity: O(n log n))

â€¢ Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves. Stable and efficient GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Quick Sort: Picks a pivot, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the partitions. Fast but not stable GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Heap Sort: Builds a heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to sort. Not stable TutorialsPoint.



ðŸš€ Linear Time Sorting Algorithms (Time Complexity: O(n) â€” Non-Comparison Based)

â€¢ Counting Sort: Counts the frequency of each element and uses it to place elements in order. Works well for integers in a limited range GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Radix Sort: Sorts numbers digit by digit using a stable sort like counting sort. Ideal for fixed-length integers GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Bucket Sort: Distributes elements into buckets and sorts each bucket individually. Best for uniformly distributed data GeeksForGeeks.


ðŸ§  Special Sorting Techniques

â€¢ Shell Sort: A generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of far-apart elements. Uses gap sequences to improve performance TutorialsPoint.
â€¢ Tim Sort: Hybrid of merge and insertion sort. Used in Python and Javaâ€™s built-in sort functions GeeksForGeeks.
â€¢ Bitonic Sort: Parallel sorting algorithm used in hardware implementations. Works on bitonic sequences GeeksForGeeks.


ðŸ“Š Sorting Properties to Know

Property	Description	
Stable Sort	Maintains relative order of equal elements (e.g., Merge, Bubble, Insertion)	
In-place Sort	Uses constant extra space (e.g., Quick, Heap, Bubble)	
Adaptive Sort	Performs better on partially sorted data (e.g., Insertion, Tim Sort)
